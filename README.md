# Design_project_NYIT

In this project we developed a gesture recognition system using a supervised K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify different gestures. This was done through observing the change in resonant frequency of a human's hand analyzed from inductive coil sensors through a microcontroller of an Arduino in the effort to move a vehicle (RC Car) move in specific directions. This provided a fulfilling experience with my team of Kevin Gay, Aritra Apon, Dave Persaud, and Yousef Ahmed with guidance by Reza K. Amineh
